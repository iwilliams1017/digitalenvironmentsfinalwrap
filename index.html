        <h2>1. System Design, Engineering and Organization</h2>
        <p>For systems design, engineering and organization, my main priority would be to address the importance of incorporating multiple systems of design to have effect digital environments specifically when producing a new product.
To create effective and successful digital environments you must consider incorporating multiple system design methodologies. Technology is ever evolving and that includes your product so continuing to evolve is as important as building a strong foundation. You can use lengthy detailed step by step process and rapid or agile methods to support your design. Personally, I think developers should use System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) or Rapid Application Development (RAD) to build your foundation and Agile Methodologies to continue to evolve. Of the 2, SDLC is more extensive and requires that you complete a preliminary analysis, system analysis, system design before even beginning to start the programming of the product. The RAD method is more focused on quickly programming, which can be a better fit depending on the deadline. It still addresses the important aspects of planning through the requirements planning and user design research phases. Neither of these methodologies include an opportunity to loop back and improve your product which is why I am recommending that the Agile Project Management methodologies are important as well. The Agile methods will allow you to continue daily review in the Iteration phase where creators can collaborate to deliver a strong product that continues to grow.</p>

        <h2>2. Content and Information Architecture</h2>
        <p>For content and information architecture I think it is important we focus on my personal opinion on the best IA Models (user flows, wireframes, and web footers) for planning your content and information.
There are many different way to architect information and content, and I am sure more ways will be discovered over time with this ever evolving world. Of the Information Architectural models we learned, I think it is important to point out user flows, wireframes and web footers as key models to prioritize. Each of these models has a benefit to the end result of your product and digital representation. First, user models allow you to identify and define your users and think about how they navigate through your pages to accomplish their goals. This model allows you to test and revise your flows, and the design allows you to understand interactions and find out how usable or useful the design is for your target audience. The second model I found important was wireframes. Wireframes are a great model for designing webpage. The obvious benefit is that you can visualize your information and content, but I think the most important thing I learned about wireframes is that they allow you to find out what gaps in information exist. The final IA model I found important would be the web footers. I think having a web footer indexing the important information is so important and its evident most website developers agree. I often see them on website I visit. Overall, using these methods you can make sure your information and content is organized in a way that benefits your users, their goals and your business overall.</p>

        <h2>3. User Experience and Visual Design</h2>
        <p>For User Experience and Visual Design, I think it’s important to touch on the main factors that influence user experience.
There are 7 main factors that ca be used to describe user experience. The factors are useful, useable, findable, credible, desirable, accessible, and valuable. For each of these factors you should ask yourself the following questions: 
1.	Useful – is the product useful in the eye of the user? This can be a practical or non-practical benefits from a purpose like banking or even just having fun and being aesthetical appealing.
2.	Usable – does the product enable users to achieve their objectives? This is a simple but important one. That we must create products that our users can use.
3.	Findable – Is the product easy to find? And is the information or content within easy to find? Staying organized and discoverable is how you accomplish this.
4.	Credible – can your users trust your product? Is the information accurate?
5.	Desirable – do users desire your product? Incorporating a design through branding, image and identity as well as aesthetics and emotional design makes your product desirable.
6.	Accessible – Does your product offer accessibility? 1 in 5 people may not be able to use your product if it isn’t built with accessibility, so it is important to be mindful of those experiences. By doing this you can create products that are even more successful and usable for your audience.
7.	Valuable – does your product deliver value? A product without value will not a have long term success.</p>

        <h2>4. Misinformation and Disinformation</h2>
        <p>Quite possibly one of the most important topics in my opinion was misinformation and disinformation. I think because it affects so many people and the only way we can control it is through educating and avoiding it, we must continue to discuss the topic so that we don’t fall for it. The two most important topics related to this are how to avoid misinformation and disinformation and understanding unconscious bias.

When it comes to misinformation, which we will use as a broad definition for both misinformation and disinformation, the most important priorities in the learnings would be understanding your unconscious bias and learning how to avoid the influence of misinformation. Unconscious bias lives within all of us and it isn’t always a malicious thing. We cannot control our unconscious biases, all we can do is stay aware and try to remove our biases when we catch them. Unconscious bias can affect our design and create non inclusive environments. There are 6 main common unconscious biases; Confirmation, Optimistic, Omission, False Consensus, Perception, and Status Quo biases. The one that stood out the most to me was confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is when we tend to look for data, feedback and behavior that affirms your existing assumptions. By continuing to stay curious and being responsive to change you can avoid this bias in your design. 
This is also a form of bias that can make you more susceptible to being a victim of misinformation. It is so important to learn how to avoid misinformation. Here are some steps to do so:
1.	Verify your information – check multiple websites to verify that the information you are receiving is real. Even credible sources can get facts wrong so always check other sources before accepting information as truth.
2.	Consider your source – always check to make sure that the story is coming from someone credible. Look at the author, the background and the sources the article provides for their information. Where are they getting the information? And are they credible enough to be reporting or sharing it?
3.	Be skeptical – don’t just accept everything you read as true. Always question the information you intake and check for named sources.
4.	Go beyond the headline – always read the full piece of information. Headlines can be misleading.
5.	Don’t trust your gut – as I shared, we all have unconscious biases, and our biases can push us to accept facts that are not true.
We are all susceptible to misinformation whether that’s believing or sharing misinformation. But when we take the time to verify our information, we can avoid falling victim to it. Stay alert and make sure too be objective and skeptical when taking in information.</p>
